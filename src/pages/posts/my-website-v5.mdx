In this fifth version, I decided to finally try a web framework to simplify some development.

However, I had specifications in mind. First I wanted a MPA with SSR for performance reasons, allowing as few JavaScript as possible for the end user, removing frameworks such as React and Solid from my list. Yet, if needed, I wanted to still be able to add dynamic zones on the website and profit from the tools from the JS ecosystem, so I ended up using **Astro**. Then, I wanted to try **Tailwind**, which is very interesting to use, but I don't feel like it's that useful now that I've tested it, especially since CSS has improved a lot. My wish to use this framework eliminated Bootstrap from the other possibilities. I also needed **MDX** to write my posts. Finally, I've been using a component library called **daisyUI**, but I don't think I used it quite correctly. I also thought of using Kobalte for a while.

Another great advantage of Astro is that it's optimized for everything measured by PageSpeed Insights: performance, accessiblity, best practices, SEO.

Rebuilding the website was also a reason to host it elsewhere. I currently publish with Vercel for their image size optimization. I tried to self-host it, but got many issues with my then setup. I'd like to try again soon though.

Finally, I've also started writing in a blog at the following address: [blog.tristanbony.me](https://blog.tristanbony.me). It's built using **Zola** with someone else's theme. The idea was also to keep it simple and lightweight.
