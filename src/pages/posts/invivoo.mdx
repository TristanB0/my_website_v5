(Work in progress)

As part of the education I received at ISIMA, I had to do an internship at the end of my second year. I went to **INVIVOO** situated in La DÃ©fense, an IT consulting company which has also created softwares for monitoring services, creating workflows and others.

My job was to start a project to match CVs with call for tenders to have the best candidates to be sent on a mission.

To realize this, I have been using **C#** to create APIs published on **Azure Functions** and stored all necessary information in a **Cosmos DB** database. To help with the matching, I have used the **OpenAI** API to create embeddings of some information from the CVs but also tried a more precise comparison focusing on skills and keywords.
