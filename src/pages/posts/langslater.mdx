## {title}

This project has for goal to translate every messages which are not in the language selected by Discord server administrators.


<!--Reason to start the project-->
I started thinking about this bot when I started reading messages which were not in the languages I know and got tired of translating every messages by hand. A bot to automate translation would have allowed me to understand conversations quicker and focus on more important things.


<!--Tools used-->
I used Python as the programming language (with discord.py wrapper) and SQL to store the target language per server in a SQLite database.


<!--Explanation-->
The bot uses slash commands to set it up.

An admin must specify a translation language so that the bot can translate messages sent in another language to this specified one.

Another functionality allows members to send a message in another language without it being translated.


<!--List of commands-->
To resume the list of commands:
- */help* shows the help with every commands available
- */set_languages [string]* is used to define the target language, the one which will not be translated (available only to administrator)
- */translate [string]* can be used to send a message in another language


Of course, if the bot is removed from a server, the information stored in the database is deleted.
