## {title}

<p>This project has for goal to translate every messages which are not in the language selected by Discord server administrators.</p>
<!--Reason to start the project-->
<p>I started thinking about this bot when I started reading messages which were not in the languages I know and got tired of translating every messages by hand. A bot to automate translation would have allowed me to understand conversations quicker and focus on more important things.</p>
<!--Tools used-->
<p>I used Python as the programming language (with discord.py wrapper) and SQL to store the target language per server in a SQLite database.</p>
<!--Explanation-->
<p>The bot uses slash commands to set it up.<br />
An admin must specify a translation language so that the bot can translate messages sent in another language to this specified one.<br />
Another functionality allows members to send a message in another language without it being translated.</p>
<!--List of commands-->
<p>To resume the list of commands:
    <ul>
        <li><i>/help</i> shows the help with every commands available</li>
        <li><i>/set_languages [string]</i> is used to define the target language, the one which will not be translated (available only to administrator)</li>
        <li><i>/translate [string]</i> can be used to send a message in another language</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>Of course, if the bot is removed from a server, the information stored in the database is deleted.</p>
