This project has for goal to translate every messages which are not in the language selected by Discord server administrators.

{/* Reason to start the project */}
I started thinking about this bot when I started reading messages which were not in the languages I know and got tired of translating every messages by hand. A bot to automate translation would have allowed me to understand conversations quicker.

{/* Tools used */}
I used **Python** as the programming language (with discord.py wrapper) and **SQL** to store the target language per server in a **SQLite** database.

{/* Explanation */}
The bot uses slash commands to set it up.

An admin must specify a translation language so that the bot can translate messages sent in another language to this specified one.

Another functionality allows members to send a message in another language without it being translated.

{/* List of commands */}

## Commands

- `/help` shows the help with every commands available
- `/set_languages [string]` is used to define the target language, the one which will not be translated (_available only to administrator_)
- `/translate [string]` can be used to send a message in another language

If the bot is removed from a server, all information regarding it stored in the database is deleted.
