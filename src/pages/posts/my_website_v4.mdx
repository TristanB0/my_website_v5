## {title}

This is the fourth version of my website I designed entirely. There was an introduction of myself, logos I made and photographs I took throughout my trips. There was also a link to Electrogen', a tech news website where I was an editor.

It was also the first time I tried to make it responsive, so that the UI changed for tablet users and mobile users.
