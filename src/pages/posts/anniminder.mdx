This project is a reminder of birthdays for Discord servers.

{/* Reason to start the project */}
I started this project when I found people were missing other people's birthday because they were storing it in plain text in a dedicated channel and often people were missing it.

{/* Tools used */}
I used **Python** for the base of the project (with discord.py API wrapper) and **SQL** to store data in a **SQLite** database.

{/* Explanation */}
The usage of the bot is very basic since it uses Discord slash commands, as explained below.

When the bot is added in a new server, an ephemeral message is sent which explains how the bot works.

Moreover, when a new user joins a server with Anniminder in it, he receives a private message to be informed of the functioning of the bot.

{/* List of commands */}

## Commands

- `/help` shows the help command with every information
- `/set_channel [channel]` is used to define a specific channel to send birthday messages in (_available only to administrator_)
- `/add_birthday [year] [month] [day]` is used by the users to add or modify their birthday. A confirmation is sent afterward as an ephemeral message
- `/remove_birthday` can be used by a user who no longer wants to be stored
- `/get_birthday [user]` is used by anyone who wants to know the birthday of someone else

Finally, when a bot is deleted from a server or when a user leaves a server, every information related to them is removed.

## Planned functionalities

Before discontinuing the bot, I planned to make the bot being able to remember any events the users want, and remind about it ther same way as birthdays. Moreover, I wanted to add the possibility to planned a weekly or monthly message using Open AI API to summarize everything, but also to create a website to facilitate the addition of dates and administration of the settings of the bot.
