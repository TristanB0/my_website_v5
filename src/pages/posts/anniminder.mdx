## {title}

This project is a reminder of birthdays for Discord servers.


I started this project when I found people were missing other people's birthday because they were storing it in plain text in a dedicated channel and often people were missing it.


I used Python for the base of the project (with discord.py API wrapper) and SQL to store data in a SQLite database.


The usage of the bot is very basic since it uses Discord slash commands.

When the bot is added in a new server, an ephemeral message is sent which explains how the bot works.

Moreover, when a new user joins a server with Anniminder in it, he will receive a private message to be informed of the functioning of the bot.


To resume the available commands:
- `/help` shows the help command with every information
- `/set_channel [channel]` is used to defined a specific channel to sent birthday messages in (available only to administrator)
- `/add_birthday [year] [month] [day]` is used by the users to add or modify their birthday. A confirmation is sent afterward as an ephemeral message
- `/remove_birthday` can be used by a user who no longer wants to be stored
- `/get_birthday [user]` is used by anyone who wants to know the birthday of someone else


Finally, when a bot is deleted from a server or when a user leaves a server, every information related to them is removed.
