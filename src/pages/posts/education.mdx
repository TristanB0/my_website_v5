(Work in progress)

My education and my perseverance to succeed has taken me to destinations I only dreamed of when I was younger. Since the first time I went to the USA, I've always wanted to come back for a longer period of time, and the partnership between my French engineering school and the University of Oklahoma made it possible. But to get to ISIMA, I had to go through the CPGE first, 2 years of hard work to prepare for competitive exams which allow students to attend the best engineering schools.

### CPGE

- French / Philosophy
- English
- Mathematics
- Physics / Chemistry
- Industrial sciences
- Computer science (Python)

{/* TIPE */}

### ISIMA

After my exams, I was admitted to ISIMA, an engineering school specialized in computer science. It is situated in Clermont-Ferrand, a city best known for its volcanoes and Michelin headquarters. This school is part of the INP group, a network of engineering school which is also a sign of quality.

#### First year

During the first year, I've learned some theoretical aspects of computer sciences, such as:
- Automata theory and formal languages
- Graph theory

I also did some maths and applied maths:
- Numerical analysis
- Probabilities
- Differential calculus
- Linear programming
- Data analysis

Engineering sciences:
- Processor physics
- Data transmission
- Signal processing
- Digital system design
- Control engineering

Computer science:
- Imperative programming (C)
- Functional programming (Scheme)
- Operating systems (Unix)
- Algorithms and data structures
- Databases
- Cybersecurity awareness

In addition, every French engineering school need to provided classes of humanities and social sciences:
- Languages (English, Mandarin Chinese)
- Management engineering
- Expression and communication

#### Second year

During the second year, I got more specialized in software engineering and information systems, but many classes I did in the first year were useful to understanding new courses, and there were still some general classes.
