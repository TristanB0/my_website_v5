(Work in progress)

My education and my perseverance to succeed has taken me to destinations I only dreamed of when I was younger. Since the first time I went to the USA, I've always wanted to come back for a longer period of time, and the partnership between my French engineering school and the University of Oklahoma made it possible. But to get to ISIMA, I had to go through the CPGE first, 2 years of hard work to prepare for competitive exams which allow students to attend the best engineering schools.


### CPGE

After high school, I decided to go to a scientific CPGE (*Higher/Graduate school preparatory classes*) to later attend an engineering school in computer science. During 2 years, I learned how to work efficiently because the workload is very high. We have written exams each week, as well as 2 to 3 oral exams to verify the recent knowledge we saw in class during the last 2 weeks, in addition to many assignments to do everyday. Everything is done to train us for the competitive exams at the end of the 2 years that will rank us to see which school we sorted we can get into. 

The different courses I had during those years were:
- French / Philosophy
- English
- Mathematics
- Physics / Chemistry
- Industrial sciences
- Computer science (Python)

On top of that, I also had to complete a project which would count in the exams. Every year there is a theme students have to comply as best as they can, during my year it was *"Societal issues: environment, safety, energy"*. I decided to analyze the optical sensor of a computer mouse because this is a tool widely used which efficiency can have a role in the health and perfomance of the user.

Even if it was a lot of pressure to attend the CPGE, the atmosphere between each student was very friendly and we helped each other a lot, which makes the experience very interesting and rewarding.


### ISIMA

After my exams, I was admitted to ISIMA, an engineering school specialized in computer science. It is situated in Clermont-Ferrand, a city best known for its volcanoes and the Michelin headquarters. This school is part of the INP group, a network of engineering school which is also a sign of quality.

#### First year

During the first year, I've learned some theoretical aspects of computer sciences, such as:
- Automata theory and formal languages
- Graph theory

I also did some maths and applied maths:
- Numerical analysis
- Probabilities
- Differential calculus
- Linear programming
- Data analysis

Engineering sciences:
- Processor physics
- Data transmission
- Signal processing
- Digital system design
- Control engineering

Computer science:
- Imperative programming (C)
- Functional programming (Scheme)
- Operating systems (Unix)
- Algorithms and data structures
- Databases
- Cybersecurity awareness

In addition, every French engineering school need to provided classes of humanities and social sciences:
- Languages (English, Mandarin Chinese)
- Management engineering
- Expression and communication

#### Second year

During the second year, I got more specialized in software engineering and information systems, but many classes I did in the first year were useful to understanding new courses, and there were still some general classes.

{/* TIG project */}

Computer science:
- Object-oriented programming (C++, Java, C#)
- Web development (React)
- Web services (REST, C#/.NET)
- UML
- IoT
- Networks
- Security and system information
- Modern architecture (Docker)
- Software architecture and quality
- Software forge (GitLab)
- Simulation
- Ergonomics of HMI
- Database development (PLSQL)
- Tools for logistics and transportation scheduling problems

Humanities and social sciences:
- Languages (English, Mandarin Chinese)
- Project management
- Expression and communication
- Management

#### IsiLabs

During my extra-curricular activities, I've also joined the IsiLabs club of the school as the communication manager. This is a club where computer enthusiasts meet to work on their personal projects, and share their knowledge with other students. Regularly, we would also organize events where someone would present a specific topic while remaining simple enough for everyone to understand. Other events include, Capture the Flag, code breaking, lock picking. My goal was to make sure every student of the school got the information of such events by sending emails and Discord messages, as well as introducing the club to new students and motivate as many people to come as possible. We would also participate in bigger school events organized by the BDE (*Student Union Office*).
