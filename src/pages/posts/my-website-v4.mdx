import { Image } from "astro:assets";

This is the fourth version of my website, which I designed entirely from scratch. There is an introduction of myself, logos I made and photographs I took throughout my trips. There is also a link to Electrogen', a tech news website where I was an editor.

Everything is made so it would fit on a single page.

import Screen_TristanB_en from "../../assets/my_website_v4/Screen_TristanB_en.png";

<figure>
    <Image src={Screen_TristanB_en} alt="My website screen in v4" />
    <figcaption>Glimpse of what it looks like.</figcaption>
</figure>

It is also the first time I tried to make it responsive, so that the UI is adapted for tablet users and mobile users.

import Screen_responsive from "../../assets/my_website_v4/Screen_responsive.png";

<figure>
    <Image src={Screen_responsive} alt="My website v4 on mobile" />
    <figcaption>How it looks like for mobile users.</figcaption>
</figure>
