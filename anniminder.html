			<h2>Anniminder (Discord Bot)</h2>

			<p>This project is a reminder of birthdays for Discord servers.</p>
            <p>I started this project when I found people were missing other people's birthday because they were storing it in plain text in a dedicated channel and often people were missing it.</p>
			<p>I used Python for the base of the project (with discord.py API wrapper) and SQL to store data in a SQLite database.</p>
			<p>The usage of the bot is very basic since it uses Discord slash commands.<br />
			When the bot is added in a new server, an ephemeral message is sent which explains how the bot works.<br />
			Moreover, when a new user joins a server with Anniminder in it, he will receive a private message to be informed of the functioning of the bot.</p>
			<p>To resume the available commands:
			<ul>
				<li><i>/help</i> shows the help command with every information</li>
				<li><i>/set_channel [channel]</i> is used to defined a specific channel to sent birthday messages in (available only to administrator)</li>
				<li><i>/add_birthday [year] [month] [day]</i> is used by the users to add or modify their birthday. A confirmation is sent afterward as an ephemeral message</li>
				<li><i>/remove_birthday</i> can be used by a user who no longer wants to be stored</li>
				<li><i>/get_birthday [user]</i> is used by anyone who wants to know the birthday of someone else</li>
			</ul></p>
			<p>Finally, when a bot is deleted from a server or when a user leaves a server, every information related to them is removed.</p>
